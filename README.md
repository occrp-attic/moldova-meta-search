# moldova-meta-search
Meta-search work at the Moldova hackathon

Project installation:

- install go language(https://golang.org/doc/install);
- run `go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin` to install required framework;
- check the config folder (there is the apache vhost and an example of supervisord setup);
- setup the reverse proxy and enable apache host;

Front-end stuff:

- gulp, npm and bower are required;
- run `npm install && bower install`
... currently working on seting up a stable build.
